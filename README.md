# *Features*
- Uses Threading Methods **`--th <Number Of Threads>` (More Threads = Faster Execution)**, (Default Value Is 4 Threads).
- Default Wait Time For A Proxy To Respond is 3 Seconds, However You can Change That --> `--timeout <Seconds>`.
- Supports `HTTP` `HTTPS` `SOCKS4` Proxies.
- Optional Json Output (`-raw`).
- Can Find Lots Of `HTTP` `HTTPS` `SOCKS4` High Speed Working Proxies Across The Internet `--fps <HTTP || HTTPS || SOCKS4>`.
- Can Validate A Singular Proxy -> `--cp <IP:Port>` Or A List Of Proxies ->`--cpl <FileName>`.
- No Additional Python Libraries Needed **`Only Regular Python3 Built-In Modules`**.
- Can Print Out Only Working Proxies By Adding `-owp`
- Can Print Out Only One Working Proxy After Finding It Or Checking it From A List Then Terminate, Using `-1`.
- Very Easy To Use.
